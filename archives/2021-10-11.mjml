          <mj-image src="https://blog.twitch.tv/assets/uploads/1306x700-blog-header-wip.jpg"></mj-image>
          <mj-text color="#fff">Interactive livestreaming platform Twitch acknowledged a "breach" after an anonymous poster on the 4chan messaging board leaked its source code, an unreleased Steam competitor from Amazon Game Studios, details of creator payouts, proprietary software development kits, and other internal tools.</mj-text>
          <mj-text color="#fff">The Amazon-owned service said it's "working with urgency to understand the extent of this," adding the data was exposed "due to an error in a Twitch server configuration change that was subsequently accessed by a malicious third party."</mj-text>
          <mj-text color="#fff">"At this time, we have no indication that login credentials have been exposed," Twitch noted in a post published late Wednesday. "Additionally, full credit card numbers are not stored by Twitch, so full credit card numbers were not exposed."</mj-text>

          <mj-image src="https://video-images.vice.com/articles/615759ef3c138e009b14c564/lede/1633119945018-cellphones.jpeg?image-resize-opts=Y3JvcD0xeHc6MC44NDI1eGg7MHh3LDAuMTU3NXhoJnJlc2l6ZT0xMjAwOiomcmVzaXplPTEyMDA6Kg"></mj-image>
          <mj-text>A company that is a critical part of the global telecommunications infrastructure used by AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and several others around the world such as Vodafone and China Mobile, quietly disclosed that hackers were inside its systems for years, impacting more than 200 of its clients and potentially millions of cellphone users worldwide.</mj-text>
          <mj-text>The company, Syniverse, revealed in a filing dated September 27 with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission that an unknown "individual or organization gained unauthorized access to databases within its network on several occasions, and that login information allowing access to or from its Electronic Data Transfer (EDT) environment was compromised for approximately 235 of its customers."</mj-text>
          <mj-text>Syniverse repeatedly declined to answer specific questions from Motherboard about the scale of the breach and what specific data was affected, but according to a person who works at a telephone carrier, whoever hacked Syniverse could have had access to metadata such as length and cost, caller and receiver's numbers, the location of the parties in the call, as well as the content of SMS text messages.</mj-text>
