          <mj-image src="https://thehackernews.com/images/-TvLsYY1ViZo/XtJ9rsBySSI/AAAAAAAA22Y/HPUE-dTSYYwGTguy3Wk5Fg3ai_Y22_fNACLcBGAsYHQ/s728-e100/sign-in-with-apple.jpg"></mj-image>
          <mj-text color="#fff">Apple recently paid Indian vulnerability researcher Bhavuk Jain a huge $100,000 bug bounty for reporting a highly critical vulnerability affecting its 'Sign in with Apple' system. The now-patched vulnerability could have allowed remote attackers to bypass authentication and take over targeted users' accounts on third-party services and apps that have been registered using 'Sign in with Apple' option.</mj-text>
          <mj-text color="#fff">Launched last year at Apple's WWDC conference, 'Sign in with Apple' feature was introduced to the world as a privacy-preserving login mechanism that allows users to sign up an account with 3rd-party apps without disclosing their actual email addresses (also used as Apple IDs). "The impact of this vulnerability was quite critical as it could have allowed a full account takeover. Many developers have integrated Sign in with Apple since it is mandatory for applications that support other social logins. To name a few that use Sign in with Apple - Dropbox, Spotify, Airbnb, Giphy (now acquired by Facebook)," Bhavuk added.</mj-text>
          <mj-text color="#fff">The researcher responsibly reported the issue to the Apple security team last month, and the company has now patched the vulnerability. Besides paying bug bounty to the researcher, in response, the company also confirmed that it did an investigation of their server logs and found the flaw was not exploited to compromise any account.</mj-text>

          <mj-text>In a survey of 1,000 people from the US and 1,000 from the UK, Tessian researchers found that 48% are less likely to follow safe data practices when working from home and 84% of IT leaders surveyed said data loss prevention is more challenging when employees are working from home.</mj-text>
          <mj-text>When asked why they put their company and its data at risk, employees gave a variety of answers, with half saying "not being watched by IT" was their main reason for not following safe data practices. Another 47% said distractions at home caused them to take more chances and 51% say security policies impeded their productivity while 40% cited the pressure to get work done quickly as a reason. Of those surveyed, 54% said they would find workarounds if security policies stop them from doing their jobs.</mj-text>
