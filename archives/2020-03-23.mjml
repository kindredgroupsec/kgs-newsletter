          <mj-image src="https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/03/20/f5e13081-922f-4ca7-90bf-2b21e2ac3e41/world-map.png"></mj-image>
          <mj-text color="#fff">A new version of the infamous Mirai botnet is exploiting a recently uncovered critical vulnerability in network-attached storage (NAS) devices in an attempt to remotely infect and control vulnerable machines. Called "Mukashi," the new variant of the malware employs brute-force attacks using different combinations of default credentials to log into Zyxel NAS, UTM, ATP, and VPN firewall products to take control of the devices and add them to a network of infected bots that can be used to carry out Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.</mj-text>
          <mj-text color="#fff">The Mirai botnet, since its discovery in 2016, has been linked to a string of large-scale DDoS attacks, including one against DNS service provider Dyn in October 2016, causing major internet platforms and services to remain inaccessible to users in Europe and North America. Just like other Mirai variants, Mukashi operates by scanning the Internet for vulnerable IoT devices like routers, NAS devices, security cameras, and digital video recorders (DVRs), looking for potential hosts that are protected only by factory-default credentials or commonly-used passwords to co-opt them into the botnet.</mj-text>
          <mj-text color="#fff">Meanwhile, at least three botnet operators have secretly exploited three zero-day vulnerabilities in LILIN digital video recorders (DVRs) for more than six months before the vendor finally patched the bugs last month, in February 2020. It will most likely take months -- if not years -- for the patch to make it to some devices. If there's an Achilles' heel to today's IoT landscape then it's the fact that there's no easy one-button-push to update firmware on most devices. Once shipped to customers, the vast majority of these systems remain unpatched until decommissioned.

          <mj-image src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70f1935921eafaade7903b462f6814bd331e52d3/0_155_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1202f246d09457a6b8b63ab9034350f3"></mj-image>
          <mj-text>As the global coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is leaving its mark across the world, at least four governments are deploying or at looking at implementing privacy-intrusive surveillance systems to track citizens and the disease's spread. Countries like China and South Korea have already deployed extensive citizen tracking systems, while Israel and the US are preparing similar surveillance measures.</mj-text>
          <mj-text> For example, the chinese government has introduced a new scheme called Health Code, which, according to the Guardian, is currently being deployed in over 100 cities. Chinese citizens can sign up for a Health Code account using their Alipay or WeChat profiles. Once they have a Health Code account, they will be assigned a color code -- red for infected, yellow for quarantined, and green for healthy. The system allegedly works by taking a user's Alipay or WeChat account history and mapping their travel history. It then weighs other factors like the time spent in outbreak hotspots and if the user had contact with other citizens deemed potential carriers of the virus, and then assigns a health color code.</mj-text>
          <mj-text>The system leverages the vasts quantities of mobile data and geo-location points Chinese tech companies have been collecting to map infection hotspots and then triage China's population based on their previous interactions. But if this system seems intrusive, Chinese authorities are taking it one step further in Hong Kong, where they have been using wristbands to track infected locals.</mj-text>

          <mj-image src="https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/03/16/c4838bdf-4b0b-4546-ace7-ec2fed1817ba/wp-autoupdates-screenshot-2.png"></mj-image>
          <mj-text>The WordPress developer team is working on adding an auto-update mechanism to themes and plugins, a common source of website hacks, primarily because site owners usually install themes and plugins, and then forget to update them.</mj-text>
          <mj-text>Currently, the auto-update feature is already implemented for plugins, and work is underway on adding it to WordPress' themes feature. Once the auto-update option rolls out for the stable versions of the WordPress content management system (CMS), site owners will be able to configure themes and plugins to update themselves by checking an option in their site's admin panels.</mj-text>
          <mj-text>Cyber-security firms like Sucuri, Wordfence, WebARX, and NinTechNet have often pointed out that a vast majority of today's hacked WordPress sites are being compromised after hackers exploit vulnerabilities in out-of-date plugins and themes. This feature is expected to reduce the number of hacked WordPress sites, once it rolls out with the upcoming WordPress 5.5 release.</mj-text>
