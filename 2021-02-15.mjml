          <mj-image src="https://thehackernews.com/images/-LvkB3SpXP_A/YCUE6Ebc75I/AAAAAAAABv0/V0NLeUr8CdAyBF5DXlAgSIazyJlX7KkjwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/sim-swapping.jpg"></mj-image>
          <mj-text color="#fff">Ten people belonging to a criminal network have been arrested in connection with a series of SIM-swapping attacks that resulted in the theft of more than $100 million by hijacking the mobile phone accounts of high-profile individuals in the U.S.

          </mj-text>
          <mj-text color="#fff">Typically achieved with the help of a corrupt insider or using social engineering lures, SIM swapping refers to the technique adopted by cybercriminals to persuade phone carriers into porting their victims' cell services to a SIM card under their control. The SIM swap then grants attackers access to incoming phone calls, text messages, and one-time verification codes (or one-time passwords) that various websites send via SMS messages as part of the two-factor authentication (2FA) process.



          </mj-text>
          <mj-text color="#fff">Once in control of the target's mobile phone, the authorities noted that the criminals accessed personal information, including contacts synced with online accounts, and stole money, with cryptocurrency losses exceeding $100 million in 2020. "They also hijacked social media accounts to post content and send messages masquerading as the victim," the U.S. Secret Service said. To avoid SIM swapping attacks, it's recommended that users keep their device's software up to date, limit data-sharing online, and enable 2FA via apps instead of having an authentication code sent over SMS.

          <mj-image src="https://thehackernews.com/images/-2lUrSJVxh4I/YB5vgYDx61I/AAAAAAAABs4/P1NLw-z_eGEDnIAlLnZhD6B2jXO9JHkTQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/browser-hacking.jpg"></mj-image>
          <mj-text>Google on Thursday removed The Great Suspender, a popular Chrome extension used by millions of users, from its Chrome Web Store for containing malware. It also took the unusual step of deactivating it from users' computers. "This extension contains malware," read a terse notification from Google, but it has since emerged that the add-on stealthily added features that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code from a remote server, including tracking users online and committing advertising fraud.

          </mj-text>
          <mj-text>The extension, which had more than two million installs before it was disabled, would suspend tabs that aren't in use, replacing them with a blank gray screen until they were reloaded upon returning to the tabs in question. According to The Register, Dean Oemcke, the extension's original developer, is said to have sold the extension in June 2020 to an unknown entity, following which two new versions were released directly to users via the Chrome Web Store (7.1.8 and 7.1.9).</mj-text>

          </mj-text>
          <mj-image src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2021/02/08/supply-chain.jpg"></mj-image>
          <mj-text>A researcher managed to breach over 35 major companies' internal systems, including Microsoft, Apple, PayPal, Shopify, Netflix, Yelp, Tesla, and Uber, in a novel software supply chain attack. The attack comprised uploading malware to open source repositories including PyPI, npm, and RubyGems, which then got distributed downstream automatically into the company's internal applications.



          </mj-text>
          <mj-text>Unlike traditional typosquatting attacks that rely on social engineering tactics or the victim misspelling a package name, this particular supply chain attack is more sophisticated as it needed no action by the victim, who automatically received the malicious packages. This is because the attack leveraged a unique design flaw of the open-source ecosystems called dependency confusion. For his ethical research efforts, the researcher has earned well over $130,000 in bug bounties.

          </mj-text>
          <mj-text>Birsan noticed some of the manifest file packages were not present on the public npm repository but were instead PayPal's privately created npm packages, used and stored internally by the company. Birsan soon realized, should a dependency package used by an application exist in both a public open-source repository and your private build, the public package would get priority and be pulled instead -- without needing any action from the developer. In some cases, as with PyPI packages, the researcher noticed that the package with the higher version would be prioritized regardless of wherever it was located. Using this technique, Birsan executed a successful supply chain attack against Microsoft, Apple, PayPal, Shopify, Netflix, Tesla, Yelp, and Uber simply by publishing public packages using the same name as the company's internal ones.
